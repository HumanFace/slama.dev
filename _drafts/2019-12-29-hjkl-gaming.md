title: HJKL Gaming
---

I recently found myself ~~studying for the upcoming exams~~ playing [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/) on my laptop and thinking of how uncomfortable it is to move with the arrow keys. It occurred to me that rebinding the controls to all be close to the home row might actually improve the playability of the game on smaller keyboards and laptops (like mine) and so I started exploring what this .

In this post, I'll be going through a few of my favorite games that I think are well suited to be played in this way.

### Preface
Since I am an avid Vim user, the movement should ideally be `hjlk`-based, and the rest of the controls should rest somewhere around the home row, preferably on it. Some games are, however, impossible to play like this, namely... pretty much anything that requires a mouse.

## Celeste
Celeste is an indie platformer about a girl climbing up a mountain. Gameplay itself is takes a few mechanics and pushes them to their absolute limits. 

### Bindings

## SMB
`buttonmap.cfg` -- 

## Cuphead
