        <strong>Robotics and programming course lecturer</strong>
		<br>
		<em><a href="http://www.vct.cz/">Vzdělávací Centrum Turnov</a></em>
        <br>
        The job description was quite similar to my previous work at VCT.
		I used the VEX Edr robot kit and Python to introduce basic concepts of robotics design and algorithms, which sparked the Robotics Simplified project (see projects section below).
		Programming was taught using Processing in Python mode, creating interactive sketches that illustrated key concepts like loops and variables.

		<br>
		<em><a href="http://www.vct.cz/">Vzdělávací Centrum Turnov</a></em>
        <br>
        As a robotics course lecturer, my job was to create the curriculum for a course (7 meetings, 1.5 hours each) focused on programming and building a LEGO Mindstorms robot, and then to teach said course to middle/high school children.

        <strong>Graph Visualizer</strong> <em>(2019)</em> [<a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiae/GraphVisualizer">GitHub</a>]
        <br>
        A Python application for visualizing discrete mathematics graphs.
        It uses the PyQt5 library and supports weighted graphs, labels, simple physics and import/export.

        <strong>Robotics Simplified</strong> <em>(2018–19)</em> [<a href="http://robotics-simplified.com/">website</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Robotics-Simplified-Website">GitHub</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiae/soc-paper-2019">whitepaper</a>]
        <br>
        A website for learning about robotics in a simple and intuitive way.
        It is powered by Jekyll and features illustrations and visualizations of the discussed concepts, code examples in Python, and is also available as a PDF.

        <strong>Metal Moose 2018</strong> <em>(2017–18)</em> [<a href="https://github.com/MetalMooseFRC/MetalMoose2018">GitHub</a>]
        <br>
        As a former member of the FRC team Metal Moose and the head of programming, I was in charge of programming our robot for the 2018 Power-Up season.
        Features of the robot include an autonomous language, double PID control (turning and driving) and a polynomial function for controlling the elevator of the robot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Project Euler </strong> <em>(2016–present)</em> [<a href="https://projecteuler.net/progress=thexiaoxiae">profile</a>]
        <br>
        I am an avid Project Euler solver, with solutions written mostly in Python, but also in Java and Haskell.
        The solutions themselves are not open source, since I want people to experience the joy of solving the problems by themselves.
