        <strong>Robotics course lecturer</strong>
        <br>
        As a lecturer of a course focused on LEGO Mindstorms, my job was to create the curriculum for the course (7 meetings, 1.5 hours each) focused on programming and building a robot, and then to teach the course to children of ages 10 through 13.

        <strong>Design and engineering laboratory internship</strong>
		<br>
		<em>Westtown School Design and Engineering Lab</em>
        <br>
        The internship included work on projects regarding the FRC team Metal Moose and on other STEM-related projects, such as an Arduino robotic arm.

        <strong>Robotics and programming course lecturer</strong>
		<br>
		<em>Vzdělávací Centrum Turnov</em>
        <br>
        The job description was quite similar to my previous work at VCT.
		I used the VEX Edr robot kit and Python to introduce basic concepts of robotics design and algorithms, which sparked the Robotics Simplified website (see projects section below).
		Programming was taught using Processing in Python mode, creating interactive sketches that illustrated key concepts like loops and variables.

        <strong>Robotics Simplified</strong> [<a href="http://robotics-simplified.com/">website</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Robotics-Simplified-Website">GitHub</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiae/soc-paper-2019">whitepaper</a>]
        <br>
        A website for learning about robotics in a simple and intuitive way.
        It is powered by Jekyll and features illustrations and visualizations of the discussed concepts, code examples in Python, and is also available as a PDF.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Graph Visualizer</strong> [<a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiae/GraphVisualizer">GitHub</a>]
        <br>
        A Python application for visualizing discrete mathematics graphs.
        It uses the PyQt5 library and supports weighted graphs, labels, simple physics and import/export.

        <strong>Metal Moose 2018</strong> [<a href="https://github.com/MetalMooseFRC/MetalMoose2018">GitHub</a>]
        <br>
        As a former member of the FRC team Metal Moose and the head of programming, I was in charge of programming our robot for the 2018 Power-Up season.
        Features of the robot include an autonomous parsing language, double PID control (turning and driving) and a polynomial function for controlling the elevator of the robot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Project Euler</strong> [<a href="https://projecteuler.net/progress=thexiaoxiae">profile</a>]
        <br>
        I am an avid Project Euler solver, with solutions written mostly in Python, but also in Java and Haskell.
        The solutions themselves are not open source, since I want people to experience the joy of solving the problems by themselves (and because I don't want my account to get suspended).
