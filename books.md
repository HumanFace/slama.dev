This section covers various kinds of books that I think are worth reading.

### Fantasy
- [The Stormlight Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive) by Brandon Sanderson -- by far the most interesting fantasy world I have ever explored. The books are relatively long (save Edgedancer, which is a novella set between the 1st and the 2nd book), but very much worth the read (or listen):
	1. [The Way of Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings)
	2. [Words of Radiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_of_Radiance)
	3. [Oathbringer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oathbringer)

- [The Kingkiller Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle) by Patrick Rothfuss -- a thrilling series that I would not recommend anyone to read until the last book in the series is finished (see the controversy for yourself if you're interested):
	1. [The Name of the Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind)
	2. [The Wise Man's Fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Man%27s_Fear)

- [Metro 2033](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033) by Dimitry Glukhovsky -- a post-apocalyptic novel about people surviving a nuclear world war inside the Moscow metro. 2033 is definitely worth the read, but the other books in the series are not as good.

### Comedy
- [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!) by Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman -- an absolute must-read (kind of)autobiography about the life of Richard Feynman. I honestly can't comprehend how this many interesting things can happen in the life of a single person.

- [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)) by Andy Weir -- a hilarious novel about an astronaut surviving on Mars, after being left for dead due to an unfortunate seres of events. It inspired a [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)#Reception), which (while not as good as the book) is also quite entertaining.

### Maths and Computer Science
- [CZ] [Průvodce labyrintem algoritmů](http://pruvodce.ucw.cz/static/pruvodce.pdf) od Martina Mareše -- úžasná příručka (a skripta) pro studium algoritmů a datových struktur.
- [CZ] [Lineární Algebra (nejen) pro informatiky](https://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~sejkoraji/sbirka/zalohy/skripta_la.pdf) od Milana Hladíka -- velice kvalitně zpracovaná skripta pro Lineární Algebru.
- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://www.csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) -- an in-depth look at how computers actually work. A good reference for CS-related courses.
