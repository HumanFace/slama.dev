This section covers various kinds of books that I think are worth reading.

### Fantasy

{:.book}
- **The Stormlight Archive** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive)] by Brandon Sanderson -- by far the most interesting fantasy world I have explored. The books are relatively long (save Edgedancer, which is a novella set between the 1st and the 2nd book), but very much worth the read (or listen).
	1. **The Way of Kings**
	2. **Words of Radiance**
	3. **Oathbringer**

- **Mistborn** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn_series)] by Brandon Sanderson -- another amazing series from Brandon Sanderson. It has a very unique magic system, despite being set in the same universe as The Stormlight Archive ([Cosmere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson#Cosmere)). The first and the second series vary greatly in their setting (medieval {% latex %}\times{% endlatex %} industrial revolution), but I would argue that both are a great fit.
	1. **The Final Empire**
	2. **The Well of Ascension**
	3. **The Hero of Ages**
	4. **The Alloy of Law**
	5. **Shadows of Self** (currently reading)
	6. **The Bands of Mourning** (yet to read)

- **The Kingkiller Chronicle** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle)] by Patrick Rothfuss -- a thrilling series that I would not recommend anyone to read until the last book in the series is finished (see the controversy for yourself if you're interested).
	1. **The Name of the Wind**
	2. **The Wise Man's Fear**

- **Metro 2033** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033)] by Dimitry Glukhovsky -- a post-apocalyptic novel about people surviving a nuclear world war inside the Moscow metro. I really appreciated that there was a healthy mix of both action-packed passages and slower, more philosophical ones. Definitely worth the read, but the other books in the series are not as good (in my opinion).

### Comedy

{:.book}
- **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!)] by Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman -- an absolute must-read auto(sort-of)biography about the life of Richard Feynman. I honestly don't understand how this many interesting things can happen in the life of a single person.

- **The Martian** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel))] by Andy Weir -- a hilarious novel about an astronaut surviving on Mars, after being left for dead due to an unfortunate series of events. It inspired a [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)#Reception), which (while not as good as the book) is also quite entertaining.

### Maths and Computer Science

{:.book}
- [CZ] **Průvodce labyrintem algoritmů** [[PDF](http://pruvodce.ucw.cz/static/pruvodce.pdf)] od Martina Mareše -- úžasná příručka (a skripta) pro studium algoritmů a datových struktur. Vřele doporučeno komukoliv, koho alespoň trochu zajímá teoretická informatika.

- [CZ] **Lineární Algebra (nejen) pro informatiky** [[PDF verze 2018](https://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~sejkoraji/sbirka/zalohy/skripta_la.pdf)] od Milana Hladíka -- kvalitně zpracovaná (byť dle mého názoru občas ne úplně přístupná) skripta pro Lineární Algebru.

- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** [[PDF 2. edice](http://guanzhou.pub/files/Computer%20System_EN.pdf)] -- an in-depth look at how computers actually work. A very comprehensive resource for CS-related courses, namely for those related to computer architecture.
