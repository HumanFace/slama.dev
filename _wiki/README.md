# Tom's Wiki
This repository contains my Wiki.

It uses (extended) Markdown syntax and relative links to reference various Wiki articles and is meant to be either viewed at `https://wiki.slama.dev` (see the [website repository](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/slama.dev) if you're interested in how the wiki is rendered), or using the [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) plugin.

Feel free to issue pull requests regarding anything found on the Wiki, if you think something is missing/incorrect/poorly phrased/whatever - they are more than welcome!
