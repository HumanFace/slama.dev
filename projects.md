This page includes some of the projects that I am/was working on (and would like to brag about ðŸ˜‡).
The programming languages they are written in are quite diverse, but Python is definitely one of my favorites!

The rest of my many (mostly unfinished) projects can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/xiaoxiae).

## Robotics Simplified [[code](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/Robotics-Simplified-Website)]
_A [website](http://robotics-simplified.com/) for learning about robotics in a simple and intuitive way._

It is powered by Jekyll (as is this website) and features illustrations and visualizations of the discussed concepts, code examples in Python, and is also available as a [PDF](http://robotics-simplified.com/assets/pdf/website.pdf).

I also wrote a [whitepaper](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/soc-paper-2019) and a [presentation](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/soc-presentation-2019) about the process of creating the website, if you're interested in what went into creating the site.


## Graph Visualizer [[code](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/GraphVisualizer)]
_A Python application for visualizing discrete mathematics graphs._

It uses the PyQt5 library and supports weighted graphs, labels, simple physics and import/export.


## Project Euler [[profile](https://projecteuler.net/progress=thexiaoxiae)]
I am an avid Project Euler solver, with solutions written mostly in Python, but also in Java and Haskell.
Feel free to add me using my friend key:

The solutions themselves are not open source, since I want people to experience the joy of solving the problems by themselves (and because I don't want my account to get suspended).


## Metal Moose 2018 [[code](https://github.com/MetalMooseFRC/MetalMoose2018)]
_2018 code repository for the FRC Team Metal Moose (#1391)._

As a former member of the FRC team Metal Moose and the head of programming, I was in charge of programming our robot for the 2018 Power-Up season.

Features of the robot include an autonomous parsing language, double PID control (turning and driving) and a polynomial function for controlling the elevator of the robot.
