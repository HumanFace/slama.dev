<h1>Hi everyone!</h1>

<p>My name is Tomáš Sláma (but please, call me Tom!) and this is my personal website (the source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiae/slama.dev">here</a>).</p>

<p>I am a 19 year old student from the Czech Republic.
Besides programming, I also like to play the viola, chess and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tomas.slama/">take photos</a>.
When it comes to sports, I enjoy climbing, slacklining and snowboarding.</p>


<p>This website mostly contains posts about things I love and enjoy talking about, like programming and music.</p>

  <p>Enjoy! ❤️</p>
