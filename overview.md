# Theme Overview

The theme supports **bold**, _italics_ and **_combined_** highlightings. It additionally supports ~~strikethrough~~.

We can also add a line break:

Code highlighting is also supported out of the box:

```python
for i in range(15):
  print(i ** 2)

print("\nDone!")
```

Block quotes can be used for things like email addresses: `john@smith.com`.
