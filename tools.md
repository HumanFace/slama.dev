Here is an exhaustive list of hardware/software that I use, and explanations as to why.
I made it to both show you cool software you might have missed, and for personal brainstorming purposes, since enjoy having things neatly organized.

If you think there are some noteworthy alternatives that I should check out, I'd be more than happy to hear about them!

## Hardware
- Laptop: [ThinkPad 11e (4th Gen)](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/11e-and-chromebooks/c/thinkpad11e) -- a durable laptop with a touchscreen (+ a pen) that I run Arch Linux on. It has a decent battery, a comfortable keyboard, and is relatively small and light.
- Mobile phone: [Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/galaxy-s8/) -- works well enough for everyday usage.

## Editing
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) -- excellent multiplatform _IDEs_ for a variety of programming languages. Made by JetBrains, a Czech company!<br/><br/>
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) -- the _ultimate text editor._ Takes a while to get used to, but being able to keep both of my hands on the home row at all times is awesome.
  - [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) -- a plugin for _managing Wikis using Vim._ Very useful for writing down things (in Markdown syntax) and easily linking them together.
  - [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips) -- a plugin for using _expanding snippets._ Greatly improved my typing speed, namely when writing code.
  - [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) -- a plugin for _(de)surrounding parts of text_ with brackets/tags. Useful for working with tag-heavy markup languages like HTML, or for bracketing in general.
  - [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors) -- handy little plugin for _managing multiple selections_. Similar to Atom and Sublime Text, only in Vim!
  - [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) -- _improves the status/tabline._ It looks quite slick, and helps with orientation.

## Command Line
- [Ranger](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ranger) -- a _text-based file manager._ It's quick, simple, and has Vim-like key bindings. I found it easier to control than Midnight Commander, but it's mostly a personal preference.
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) -- a _(f)riendly (i)nteractive (sh)ell._ Features out-of-the-box autosuggestions, has a nice scripting syntax and is overall much more pleasant to work with than Bash (at least for me).

## Internet Browsing
- [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) -- better than Chrome! I use it mostly for privacy concerns and for the fact that I find internet browser diversity an important issue.
  - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) -- better than Google Search! Same reason as FireFox.

### Addons
- [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) -- _moves tabs to the side of the browser_ -- an absolute necessity for working with multiple browser tabs.
- [Vim Vixen](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/) -- _browsing with Vim-like bindings_ -- provides a much faster browsing experience than using a mouse (in most cases).<br/><br/>
- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) -- a fast and _reliable add blocker._
- [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/) -- a _smart tracker blocker._
- [BlockSite](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocksite/) -- _blocks specified sites_. ~~Sort of~~ helps to combat procrastination.
- [I don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/) -- _automatically accepts website cookies_.
- [Nuke Anything](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nuke-anything-enhanced/) -- _removes selected elements_ from websites. Useful for blocking add blocker blockers.

## Audio/Video
- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) -- a _multiplatform media player._ Plays everything, without any issues!
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) -- a _multiplatform audio editor._ A quality multiplatform open source program for editing audio files.

## Graphics
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) -- a _bitmap image editor._
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) -- a _vector image editor._
- [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360) -- a stellar _CAD software_ (free for students) that I use for all of my CAD modeling.

## Note-taking
- [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) -- an app for _taking handwritten notes._ It's a worthy alternative to OneNote that I use to manage all of my school notes.

## Miscellaneous
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) -- a _Git client,_ since I am not really used to working with Git on the command line.
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) -- a _tiling window manager_ that I use on my Arch Linux laptop. Great for managing multiple desktops and apps.
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) -- a decentralized cross-platform app for _syncing files._ I use it to seamlessly sync all of my data across an Android phone, a Linux laptop, and a Windows PC.
